# My Management README

## About Me

### Quick Facts

- I am a family man, nerd, and workaholic. I have two young boys who have my attention most non-working hours. I am also an introvert which means I am an extremely BORING person.
- Things I am working on as an individual in no particular order:
  - Taking over the discussion
  - Giving positive feedback
  - Thinking and talking at, the, same, time
  - Friendly small talk

### Leadership Style

- I firmly believe a leader does two things: #1 enables others to accomplish their goals (read servant leader) and #2 sets an example for other to follow.
- I also believe no person is perfect, mistakes will be made so how a person reacts and learns from a failure is a key measure of their ability to improve.
- I like most communication to be short and to the point and only like to get into the details if there is a problem that needs my help fixing.
- I will delegate as much responsibility as you can handle.

## For You

### My expectations of my reports

- Understand the Why. Why is the work your doing valuable?
- Understand your role in any given plan. Who depends on your output, and whose output do you depend on?
- Be transparent and direct. I can only help if I have the information necessary to act.
- Manage your time - this means be clear about your availability and be practical in your estimates
- Don't fight, collaborate. We are all on the same team.
- DO NOT fall into the trap of labelling employees as 'others'.
- Don't be a yes man, decisions require context and justification.
- Don't ignore the company Kool-Aid.
- Ask for Help
- Ask for Training

- Expect a regularly scheduled 1 on 1
  - If something is urgent and especially if something is eating you up reach out immediately.
  - My first question is always "How are you?"
  - Don't give me status. Do give me your stress level, feedback on me, feedback on your team, fears, wants, needs, high fives and fist bumps.
  - Be prepared. Take 5 minutes to think about what you want most out of our conversation.
  - It's your meeting, reschedule if you need to.
- My calendar is almost always up to date so you can always grab 5 minutes of my time.
- I question everything, do not take it as direct criticism of your work
