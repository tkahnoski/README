# Expectations when working remotely

- You communicate with your team as soon as your dates are set and remind them the day before and the morning of.
- You send me an email with a short reason why. (Done!)
- You are actively present. (More on this below)
- You write out your standup update to the team in the Team Room.

## Active Presence in Chat when Remote

1. Be explicit with the team about when you are or are not available. Being explicit also helps you focus on the non-work things. (Take it from me whose addicted to my phone) Examples:

   - If you go out to lunch, let the team know when you leave and when you come back.
   - Let the team know when you sign off for the day.
   - If your stepping into the doctor’s office let them know you won’t be responding to chats for a while.

2. Leverage audio/video calling as much as possible. Most IM clients now have built in features to make this easy when chat/email are inefficient.
